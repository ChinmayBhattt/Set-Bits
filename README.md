# Set-Bits

This repository contains a collection of functions for performing bitwise operations, including binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions, as well as counting set bits (1's) in binary numbers. The main focus is on implementing bitwise AND operations and analyzing the results in terms of binary and decimal representations. This toolkit is designed to help understand and work with binary numbers and their operations efficiently.
